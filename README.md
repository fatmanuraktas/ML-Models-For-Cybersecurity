# ML-Models-For-Cybersecurity
More than twenty practical cases with real datasets of application of Machine Learning to the field of Cybersecurity 
This repository is taken from [Shramos' Practical ML For Cybersecurity Repo](https://github.com/shramos/practical-ml-for-cybersecurity). Since the original notebooks were in Spanish, I translated all notebooks into English. I also added extra notes where clarification was needed from source libraries and made small updates for cleaner, more up-to-date code. Many thanks to Shramos for the original repository!

Installation

To run these exercises, it is recommended to install the Anaconda distribution, which includes all the necessary utilities.

Once Anaconda is installed, you can download the exercises using the following command:

<pre> ```bash git clone https://github.com/fatmanuraktas/ML-Models-For-Cybersecurity.git cd ML-Models-For-Cybersecurity jupyter notebook ``` </pre>

With Jupyter Notebook, included in Anaconda, you can view and run the downloaded files.

Note: For those without a proper Anaconda environment, the exercises can also be executed in the cloud via Google Colaboratory, by clicking the link at the beginning of each notebook.
